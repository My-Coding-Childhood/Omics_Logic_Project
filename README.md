Topic: The use of Pymol and UCSF Chimera to visualize BRCA1 protein alignment.

In structure-function research, related structures are visualized and compared. I started working on this project to learn more about and gain ease in utilizing Pymol and UCSF Chimera to see how two (2) distinct BRCA1 proteins aligned to one another. AlphaFold, BlastP, EMBL-EBI, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, PDB database, UCSF Chimera, and Pymol were the tools utilized for this study. For the purpose of developing a breast cancer cure, researchers studying BRCA1 proteins will find this project useful.
